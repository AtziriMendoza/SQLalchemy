# SQLalchemy

This challenge consisted of two parts. I was able to analyze and explore the climate data and create a climate app by creating a Flask API. My API and analyzing code "climaate_final.ipynb" is in the cowabunga folder.

The purpose of this challenge was to run queries in python using sqlalchemy and use those queries to create an API flask so information can be extracted from our queries.
